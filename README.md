## Description

I've asked Dall-E the AI image generator, to help me create a warm welcome image for my portfolio visitors, and I hope you like what it did!
I am a new developer undergoing a year-long bootcamp where I'll graduate as a Full Stack Developer in March 2023. I am actively looking for an interesting entry opportunity, if you'd like to connect I provide all my social links in my portfolio app for you.
