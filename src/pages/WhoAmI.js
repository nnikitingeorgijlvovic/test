        I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer riding the bootcamp wave, and am
        actively seeking for an exciting entry opportunity. This web-app is my
        personal porfolio and 100% written from scratch by me. It is so exiting
        to be able to create something like this page.{" "}

        My fascination for technology started early, I've literally grown up
        seeing the first computers coming out, and had the priviledge to play
        Doom accessing it from DOS on a Pentium PC, a few years later playing
        chess on a dialed-up internet while listening to music from CD's...
        exiting transformations happening so incredibly fast.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Later on, I got to work for great companies in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
        commercialy in IT. With some corporate exposure, learning and qualifying
        myself constantly, and after living great adventures around the world
        that brought me significant personal growth, I now seek to establish a
        carrer in IT as a Full Stack Developer.{" "}

        I'm heading towards my final project at the bootcamp and will be
        graduating in March 2023. Nevertheless, my eyes and ears are already
        open to opportunities in the market. If you'd like to know more about me
        or to send me a message, simply use the links above and I look forward
        to hearing from you.
