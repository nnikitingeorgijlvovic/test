        I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer at the final project phase in a
        year-long Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, where I am learning the
        latest technologies and best practices in the area, focused on MERN
        stack and JavaScript environment in general. This web-app is my personal
        porfolio and 100% written from scratch by me. Lot's to be improved, yet
        an incredible experience to be able to create something as this webapp.{" "}

        My fascination with technology started at a young age. I grew up seeing
        the first computers being developed and had the privilege of playing
        Doom on a Pentium PC using DOS. A few years later, I was playing chess
        on a dial-up internet connection while listening to music on CD's. It's
        amazing to see how technology has transformed so quickly over the years.{" "}

        <br />
        After gaining some corporate experience in IT and living many exciting
        adventures around the world that brought me personal growth, I now seek
        to establish a career in IT as a Full Stack Developer.{" "}

        <br />I am currently completing my journey at the course and expect to
        graduate end of March 2023. From then on, open to an opportunity in
        Germany. To learn more about me, please use the links above. I look
        forward to hearing from you.
