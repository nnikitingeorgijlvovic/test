        I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Hamburg, Germany. I've recently
        completed a year-long bootcamp where I've learned the latest
        technologies and best practices in the field, with a focus on MERN stack
        and the JavaScript environment. I'm passionate about using my skills to
        build amazing projects and solve complex problems.

        repay that faith with hard work, dedication, and a commitment to
        excellence. I'm excited to embark on this new chapter of my career and
        to make a positive impact within my new team.
