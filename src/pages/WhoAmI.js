        I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer currently enrolled in a year-long Full
        Stack Development bootcamp, where I am learning the latest technologies
        and best practices in web development. This web-app is my personal
        porfolio and 100% written from scratch by me. It is an incredible
        experience to be able to create something like this page.{" "}

        My fascination with technology started at a young age. I grew up seeing
        the first computers being developed and had the privilege of playing
        Doom on a Pentium PC using DOS. A few years later, I was playing chess
        on a dial-up internet connection while listening to music on CD's. It's
        amazing to see how technology has transformed so quickly over the years.{" "}

        <br />
        After gaining some corporate experience in IT and living many exciting
        adventures around the world that brought me personal growth, I now seek
        to establish a career in IT as a Full Stack Developer.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />I am currently completing my journey at the bootcamp and expect to
        graduate in March 2023. However, I am already looking for opportunities
        in the market. If you'd like to learn more about me or send me a
        message, simply use the links above. I look forward to hearing from you.
