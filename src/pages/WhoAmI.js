        I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Hamburg, Germany. I've recently
        completed a year-long bootcamp where I've learned the latest
        technologies and best practices in the field, with a focus on MERN stack
        and the JavaScript environment. Now I'm working as a Jr Software
        Developer at an incredible company filled with great people with whom I
        appreciate our work days a lot. I'm a lucky man, passionate about using
        my skills to be of service and solve complex problems.
